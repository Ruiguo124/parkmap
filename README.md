# Park Map

## Inspiration
Many times I find a parking spot in downtown Montreal only to realize when I go to pay that I can't park in that spot. I then have to drive more to another spot which increases pollution. Park Map is here to fix that issue.

## What it does
Our Android App is an crowd-sourced interactive map of all the parking signs and their availabilities in Montreal. To add data, users simply take a picture of the parking sign and our AI will determine if he is eligible to park in that spot. A marker is then added on the map with which other users can tell at a glance if they can park there at this time of the day.

## How we built it
The app was built using Java and Android Studio. We also used the Google Firebase API and the Google Maps Platform for our AI.
